GifChat
======
with apologies to http://chat.meatspac.es

This is going to be a more fully-featured clone of the popular minimalist gif-chatting site chat.meatspac.es. I'm building
it for my own team in order to make remote collaboration a bit more fun. Here's the breakdown:

Back End: Play Framework with no bells or whistles. It serves static content and maintains websocket channel state. I hope
to pull this out and replace it with a Clojure-based implementation soon, but for now this was the quickest way to get
a server up and running so that I could focus on the front end.

Front End: AngularJS, with the websocket wrapped in an injectable service and the core chat component implemented as a
reusable directive.

Still super minimalist, but I want to add a few features that meatspace chat does not. First of all I plan to add auth,
which would have users log in using their twitter accounts for identity. I'm going to integrate with OS-level
notifications so that you can get notified (even texted?) when someone does X. I want to add various utilities for scripting,
so that bots can be written to join the chat and respond to certain kinds of messages. Various kinds of logging and
the ability to export gifs into reusable macros, things like that.
